    <h1>Israel and the Palestinians: History of the conflict explained</h1>

    <div class="article-section">
      <div class="text">
        <p>There have been a series of wars between Israel and Arab nations. Uprisings - called intifadas - against Israeli occupation, and reprisals and crackdowns by Israel have also taken place.</p>
        
        <p>The consequences of the historic dispute over issues including land, borders and rights are still being felt, and include the latest war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.</p>
        
        <p>What was Israel before 1948 and how was it created? Britain took control of the area known as Palestine in World War One, following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, which had ruled that part of the Middle East.</p>
        
        <p>An Arab majority and a Jewish minority lived there, as well as other ethnic groups. Tensions between the Jewish and Arab populations deepened when the UK agreed in principle to the establishment of a "national home" in Palestine for Jewish people - a pledge known as the Balfour Declaration.</p>

      <div class="text">
        <p>Jews had historical links to the land, but Palestinian Arabs also had a claim dating back centuries and opposed the move. The British said the rights of Palestinian Arabs already living there had to be protected.</p>
        
        <p>Between the 1920s and 1940s the number of Jews arriving grew, with many fleeing persecution in Europe. The murder of six million Jews during the Holocaust gave added urgency to demands for a safe haven.</p>
        
        <p>The Jewish population reached 630,000, just over 30% of the population, by 1947. In 1947, against a backdrop of growing violence between Jews and Arabs - and against British rule - the United Nations (UN) voted for Palestine to be split into separate Jewish and Arab states. Jerusalem would become an international city.</p>
        
        <p>No Arab nations supported this. They argued the plan gave the Jews more of the land, even though their population was smaller. Britain abstained. It decided to withdraw and to hand the problem to the UN at the end of 14 May 1948.</p>
      </div>

    <div class="article-section">
      <div class="text">
        <p>Jewish leaders in Palestine declared an independent state known as Israel hours before British rule ended. Israel was recognised by the UN the following year.</p>
        
        <p>What was the 1948 Arab-Israeli war? The day after Israel declared independence, it was attacked and surrounded by the armies of five Arab nations. The conflict came to be known in Israel as its war of independence.</p>
        
        <p>By the time the fighting ended with an armistice in 1949, Israel controlled most of the territory. Agreements left Egypt occupying the Gaza Strip, Jordan occupying the West Bank and East Jerusalem, and Israel occupying West Jerusalem.</p>
        
        <p>About 750,000 Palestinians fled, or were forced from, their homes on land which became Israel and ended up as refugees. The event is known in Arabic as the Nakba (Catastrophe). In the years that followed, hundreds of thousands of Jews left, or were expelled from, Muslim majority countries across the Middle East and North Africa, with many going to Israel.</p>

        <p>What was the 1967 Middle East war? What is known as the Six-Day War changed boundaries in the Middle East and had major consequences for Palestinians. The war saw Israel fight Egypt, Syria and Jordan.</p>
        
        <p>It started when Israel, fearing an attack by Egypt and Syria, launched a strike on Egypt's air force. By the time the fighting ended, Israel had captured the Sinai Peninsula and Gaza from Egypt, most of the Golan Heights from Syria, and East Jerusalem and the West Bank from Jordan.</p>
        
        <p>About a million Palestinians in the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem came under Israel's control. Israel's occupation of these areas has lasted until this day. Israel signed a peace treaty with Egypt in 1979 and returned the Sinai.</p>
